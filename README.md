# Customer-churn-analysis-

I've created a real-time comprehensive Power BI report using CSV and Excel workbook data sources. Client-focused on tracking customer churn, I developed an end-to-end report from data gathering to deployment on Power BI service, aligned with the BRD document.

Insights from the customer churn analysis:
- Yearly analysis shows a growth in exit customers.
- September and November witness higher churn compared to other months.
- 36-50 age group customers are leaving the bank the most.
- Customers with Fair credit scores and predominantly females are more likely to leave.

These insights empowered stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, reducing customer churn and boosting retention rate by 40%.
